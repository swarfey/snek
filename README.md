# snek
A super simple game of snake using console logs in node.js.

To start the game make sure that you have node installed and run `node snek.js` in the root folder.
You might want to adjust your settings first (located in the cfg.json file), especially to get the width and height right for your terminal. You may also activate random Obstacle mode which will draw random wall tiles in free spaces or adjust the framerate.

(Honestly I made this when I had no internet and was really bored)
